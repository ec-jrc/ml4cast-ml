#The commands that might need to be updated in your submit files are:
#initialdir
#executable
#arguments

#initialdir should point to the directory containing your HTCondor submit file. This folder must be a subfolder of your EOS project folder.
#executable should contain the full path to the executable file in your docker container. Most often it will be /bin/bash but it could also be the path to the R executable in case your processing is relying on R.
#arguments should contain the full path to the script to be run together with the arguments passed to it.
